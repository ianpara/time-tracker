## My process

### Built with

- React (This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).)
- TailwindCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

A lot! First project built using React and TailwindCSS. Really enjoyed learning React and how easy it was to work with. Tailwind will get some gettiing used to, but I think I'll start using for most of my projects.

### Useful resources

- [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheNetNinja) - Incredible tutorials on most web dev things. Helped with React and Tailwind.
